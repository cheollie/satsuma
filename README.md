# satsuma
the race to productivity :)

Satsuma is a Chrome Extension aiming to help students and people in the workplace with productivity (and motivation) by making it more fun to complete assigned tasks.

## to use:
1. click the green `code` button on github
2. click download as zip (and unzip it)
3. go to `chrome://extensions/`
4. make sure developer mode is on
5. click `load unpacked` and select the downloaded unzipped file

## disclaimer: 
this is a really rough mockup, full design and plan can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/mADfKZ9dWvVoM6CKku7TR0/satsuma-final?node-id=0%3A1).

also this was made on qoom ([source code also on qoom](https://stiffstars2.qoom.space/~/Satsuma) but will migrate here), this repo was just to make it a chrome extension
